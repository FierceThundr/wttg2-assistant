			<p class="text-justify"> Welcome to the rule of three 3 III. The world is a dangerous place and fewer and fewer people are willing to make a difference.
				People are in pain and need help. Maybe you believe there is nothing you can do. We know what it is like to feel helpless
				in a world that leave us all isolated from each other. You are not alone. Believe me when I say you have the power to
				help people within you right now as you read this. It wasn't long ago that I felt the same way until I discovered a network
				of people who helped me unlock my inner savior. We can all help mankind working together in the way of three. </p>

				impact on our world. Be kind to each other. Be free with each other. Love each other. None will know our contribution
				to the world but that is the life of a savior. May we all see one two three.
				<br>
				<br> Even the smallest of contributions to the energy shield will amplify our will. Prevent pain, prevent sadness, and even
				prevent death. When you turn off a light. One two three. When you lock your door. One two three. When you stir your coffee.
				One two three. Each three will build upon the three of the others. Together we can save humanity and protect one another.

			<p class="text-justify"> Our world is surrounded by an energy that connects us all yet is invisible to the eye. It can guide our lives, keep us
				healthy, or hurt the ones we love if not kept strong. Replenishing this energy shield is very important for the wellbeing
				of everyone in our lives and for you. The power of performing thirds is NOT a superstition as the government would have
				you believe. </p>

			<p class="text-justify"> If you find you are still in doubt, simply try the way of three for a single day and you will see your life feels more

				still protected by our actions and we will always be here to do so. </p>
