            <p>I'm still here... I haven't been found. You will only know where I've been when the earth shakes and the
                nitrogen fills your lungs and chokes your final moments from your body.
            </p>
            <p>So many inferior creatures disgracing everything that humanity should be. All scratching at the insipid
                crust of the sycophants who aid the greedy. Pleading for someone to acknowledge their existence long
                enough so they can forget it themselves. All of you are <a class="CPTAG">worthless</a>...
            </p>
            <p>The dirty homeless, rotting on our streets, forcing us to feel as though we owe them anything. The rich
                who make the rules for everyone only to rape those who work hardest for their admiration. You fucking
                worker bees who happily <a class="CFTAG">support</a> it all on <em class="PTAG"></em> your backs so you can feel like you mean anything to this
                world for the two seconds you see someone liked your status. You mean nothing. Your life is worthless.
                All of you deserve to die. If you don't have the balls to recognize that your life gives nothing to
                this world and put and end to it yourself, then I will happily do it for you.
            </p>
            <p>The news will explain so many deaths away as accidental. Mechanical failures at factories, leaking gas
                lines in houses, improper procedure when <a class="CFTAG">transporting</a> flammable materials. It's all bullshit. They
                don't want you to know that the dots are connected. That you should fear for your shit stain of a life.
                That you are all burning at my hand.
            </p>
            <p>I have only gotten more <a class="CPTAG">proficient</a> and better suited for not being tracked by the police. You will die.
                Never feel safe.
            </p>
            <p>I could simply turn to chemicals, biological methods, or any other of a litany of methods... but I love
                the explosives. You know why? You are wiped out. Instantly. It's all you squirming masses deserve. You
                have no time to reflect on your <a class="CFTAG">loved</a> ones. No time to try to understand WHY this is happening to you.
                I don't give you that satisfaction. You don't deserve it.
            </p>
            <p>You made your choices. You live the way you do. You have corrupted your children. So the result is
                already made up as well.
            </p>
            <p>When you are riding on the train to work and the children are waiting patiently to arrive at their stop
                for school. You will feel the air compress your <em class="PTAG"></em> body with a massive force as the pressure is instantly
                altered and your air is sucked out from your grasp. The heat will come long after your death and your
                remains will be ashes. A symbol of your impact on the world. Instantly forgotten. Instantly nothing.
                This is why I love the <a class="CPTAG">bomb</a>.
            </p>
            <p>You are never safe.</p>
