        <h1>THE GREY DESCENDENTS</h1>
        <p>The arch was created by the <a class="CPTAG">Annunaki</a> when the <a class="CFTAG">pyramids</a> were first <em class="PTAG"></em> constructed and is the only
            functional piece of ancient <a class="CFTAG">alien</a> technology left.</p>
        <p>They left a portion of their kind here on earth to safeguard the <a class="CPTAG">technology</a>.</p>
        <p>These descendents have become who we now know as the grey aliens.</p>

        <p>We will never see these beings as they live only on heavily protected <a class="CPTAG">military</a> compounds in the US.</p>
        <p>America offered them safety and <em class="PTAG"></em> luxurious living conditions as part of the agreement to transport the arch to America.</p>
