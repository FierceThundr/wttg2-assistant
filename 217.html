			<p class="strong"> A NUCLEAR EXPLOSION SO POWERFUL OVER NEW YORK CITY THAT
				<br> WINDOWS IN HOUSES IN NORTHERN CANADA WILL BE BLOWN OUT!!! </p>
			<p> (My Dream Begins)
				<br> I was hitchhiking in Canada to get to a highway that curves through Quebec heading south to the States. A truck driver
				gives me a ride. While we are traveling through the forests, I see a glowing orange nuclear mushroom cloud. It was over
				New York City, and it got very large, very fast, and I was surprised that, it being so powerful, it produced a very strong
				blast of wind where we were in northern Canada. We <em class="PTAG"></em> arrived at a small town and I looked at some of the houses as we passed.
				I saw the windows had been broken on many houses yet people were still living inside them.

			<h1 class="text-underline strong"> The Vision of the Future of New York City </h1>
			<p> After fasting about a day or so, I got this vision fro God, which lasted quite a while. </p>
			<p> I was looking at the Manhattan skyline from the west, from New Jersey. It was almost dark after sunset, and only a little
				bit of daylight was still visible. There were no lights on any of the sky scrappers, and they were totally empty. without
				any office workers or residents. These towers were in a stat of advanced ruin, and their internal steel frames could
				be seen protruding from their tops and some of their side places too. There were absolutely no people living there in
				Manhattan, for the city had been abandoned. </p>
