			"Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was
			found for them. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book
			was opened, which is the <a class="CPTAG">book</a> of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they
			had done. And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were
			judged, each one of them, according to what they had <em class="PTAG"></em> done. Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This
			is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into
			the lake of fire."</p>
		<p class="text-center text-normal">Good evening child.</p>
		<p class="mt">I ask that you join me in prayer once again for, sadly, our work is not done.</p>
		<p>The sin of man continues to proliferate. They go blindly forward into the heard of swine allowing the demon soldiers of the
			devil to whisper influence into their souls. Sodomy! Transsexuals! Homosexuals! All thriving in a world that is embracing
			their sin. Hear me my brothers and sisters when I say that the end is <a class="CFTAG">near</a>. A cleansing of all children on this earth.</p>
		<p>The filth of the world walk it with <a class="CPTAG">protection</a> from our Governments and their false prophets. They walk with no fear of God
			and being proud of their sinful ways. They are proud to cast god from their souls and to never know him.</p>
		<p>Too long have we worked tirelessly to guide the lost sheep of the lords heard back into his light only to be treated as a
			sickness by these ungrateful heathens. Their day of judgment has come! No more will we be the gentle guiding hand. No
			more will we let the weak and sinful continue to take over god's gift of life.</p>
		<p class="bold text-normal">NO <a class="CFTAG">MORE</a>!</p>
		<p>On our day of judgment, we saints will be accepted into the kingdom of heaven and the sinners will be cast out from the sight
			of GOD by fire as it is told in Isaiah 66:15-16</p>
		<p class="bold">
			&quot;For behold, the LORD will come in fire And His chariots like the whirlwind, To render His anger with fury, And His
			rebuke with flames of fire. For the LORD will <em class="PTAG"></em> execute judgment by fire And by His sword on all flesh, And those slain
			by the LORD will be many.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			WE will bring this FIRE! WE are the instruments of the LORD! WE will BURN these <a class="CPTAG">Heretics</a> at the Cross, one by one they will
			be known to the lord GOD for the sins they have committed. Only when we hear their screams as their filth is purged from
			the planet we will rejoice and praise God!
		</p>
		<p>
			Take my hand child of GOD. The righteous reading these words must JOIN US! Join us and cleanse this Earth of the Heretics
			that walk it. There are many who join every single day just like you. We will <a class="CFTAG">save</a> this world. We will force gods love
			upon them in flame!
