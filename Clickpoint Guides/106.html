		<h1 class="pbs">BURIAL OF A BODY</h1>
		<p class="pbs"> I don't recommend burial as there are a lot of mistakes that can be easily made. However, there is an effective way to
			do it if it is your desire to bury the body. Transport is very important. You want to keep the body bound up in the fetal
			position in some large fabric like a thick blanked, then multiple layers of <a class="CFTAG">garbage</a> bags sealing up as much as possible.
			Back your car as close as possible to your home. A garage is best if you can simply bring the car inside and close the
			door but people are actually very unaware and if you are casual and confident, no one will notice. </p>
		<p class="pbs">
		If you don't have a garage, recommend having a number of garbage bags to put in the car. Laundry is a great excuse for
			having many large <em class="PTAG"></em> bags. Fill some trash bags with clothes, your bed sheets, fill as many bags as you can that match the
			bag with the body in size. Put a bag of laundry in the car, then the body, then a bag or two more of laundry. Whatever
			will fit within reason. This is why having the body in the <a class="CPTAG">fetal</a> position is important. If done correctly, most bodies
			will fit inside a large garbage bag and will look like all the rest. </p>
		<p class="pbs"> Do not bring your own shovel. Putting all that in your car then adding a shovel will look suspicious. Just get in your
			car and go. Stop at a store, purchase something, and get about 40 dollars cash back. Go to a hardware store and buy a
			shovel and some work gloves. </p>
		<p class="pbs"> Next is where it can get a little difficult but will make burial work. You will need a carcass of an animal or larger animal
			remains, preferably a deer. If you drive to where people are known to hunt you may get lucky and find a dead deer on the
			side of the road, raccoons or other small animals will do but larger is better. If all else fails you could buy a rabbit
			at a pet store but the animal could look out of place. </p>
		<a class="CFTAG"><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/b7ad9ef7-7461-4b80-8af2-60feeb7d5bcb%2Fdiagram.jpg" class="pull-right" width="600" height="300"></a>
		<p class="pbs"> Hunters usually bury animal remains on site and it's not uncommon in general to find animal carcasses buried a few feet
			deep under ground. Especially in areas where people are known to hunt. Head out to your burial site and dig a hole 6 feet
			deep or more. Bury the body until you have about 2 <em class="PTAG"></em> feet left then place your animal remains inside the hole and bury it.
			Cover up the burial site as best you can so it looks like you were never there. </p>
		<p class="pbs"> The reason for doing this is basically insurance for if the police start a search and they decide to search the area you
			buried the body in. Search <a class="CPTAG">dogs</a> will stop at your site as they usually would but when the police dig a few feet, they
			will find the animal remains and assume a hunter or other animal had buried the remains and move on. </p>
		<p class="pbs">
		Get rid of the shovel at a random dumpster in the middle of nowhere away form the burial site and keep the work gloves
			unless they somehow became soiled with DNA from the body. If you brought laundry with you. Change your clothes, go to
			the Laundromat and do a load of laundry including the <a class="CFTAG">clothes</a> you buried the body in and the work gloves. Once the laundry
			is done, change back into the clothes you wore when you left. Head home and unload your laundry. </p>
