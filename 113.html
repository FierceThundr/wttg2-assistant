			<em class="PTAG pull-left text-dark"></em>
			<p class="text-left"> I've been a drone <a class="CPTAG">hobbyist</a> for a many years now. I have several hundred hours logged flying <a class="CFTAG">drones</a> of various kinds and
				have become a rather good pilot. I've also won a number of high speed drone races. To put it bluntly. I'm damn good at
				flying. </p>
			<p class="text-left"> But I need to make money like everyone else. Drones cost a lot to build and <a class="CPTAG">maintain</a>. The prizes for races are small and
				my parents don't give me an <a class="CFTAG">allowance</a> of any kind and I'm not getting a job like a bitch. This is where you and your
				gross voyeuristic fantasies come in. </p>
			<p class="text-left"> There are a lot of hot girls in my neighborhood and surrounding cities. I use my <a class="CFTAG">skills</a> to snag videos and pictures of
				girls undressing in their <a class="CPTAG">rooms</a>, sun bathing on the beach, laying out naked in their back yard. You name it. I've found
				it and I'm so damn fast that I get some great footage even if they notice me. You can check out the videos I've taken
				here for a fee. <em class="PTAG"></em> I don't give anything away for free. Alright? So don't ask. </p>
