			<p> Welcome. We are glad to have you here with us. Many <a class="CPTAG">souls</a> are tossed about by the turbulent winds of their emotions every
				day of their lives. We become so engrossed in our own being and our own gratification that we often forget that there
				is another living, breathing, human behind every angry outburst, sigh of frustration, and careless act that we give birth
				to and let fly free into the world. </p>
			<p> We, as a people on this beautiful earth, have lost our <a class="CFTAG">ability</a> to empathize and truly let those who are our own brothers
				and sisters live the way they wish to live. You to yours and I to mine. So many are selfish and lost that they can no
				longer feel. This is true torture to the soul. To <a class="CPTAG">live</a> but be consumed by anger or dizzying excitement over someone else's
				life and choices that you may never know your own. We in the shade of grey want true equality. We want to simply let
				others live the path their own lives provide. You to yours and I to mine. </p>
			<p> Those who truly live in grey are neutral. We simply let others be the piece of art that each of us are born to be. We
				live the lives we live and we die when the great forces of our universe decide that we shall. If one is meant to be judged
				by their own actions, so be it. If one is meant to devote their love to others and influence peace, so be it. You to
				yours and I to mine. </p>
			<p> If you feel the desire to be truly free and live your own way while other's live theirs. Please join us in the shade and
				learn more of our ways in the walls of interius. Become grey and bring true equality to yourself and our world. </p>

			<p class="text-underline strong"> THE <em class="PTAG"></em> INTERIUS </p>
			<p> Our symbol consists of three parts called walls. This is because when you are in the shade. The shade of grey. You are
				living within your own house. Three walls because it is the minimum needed to provide a full enclosure for your wellbeing.
				We are not materialistic and do not seek what we do not need. The walls in our symbol are parallel because our walls
				are still open to the world though we dwell safely within them. We are not shut off from the actions of others. We do
				not bury our heads in the sand and pretend all is right. We simply except the world as it unfolds. </p>
			<p> Finally, the center. The Self. You are your own house within the walls of interius. Within your soul is the true source
				of our shade yet still empty and open. Not filled with life's inconveniences or cares. </p>
			<p> While symbolic of our way life. The interius <em class="PTAG"></em> is also representative of the path to the shade of grey. The walls of interius
				are broken into three lessons to become a member in our chain. </p>
			<p class="text-center"> <a class="CPTAG">LATUS</a>
				<br> Our outer perception of the world and the way we are perceived by others. </p>
			<p class="text-center"> <a class="CFTAG">CENTRUM</a>
				<br> The way we live as ourselves for ourselves. </p>
			<p class="text-center"> INANIS
				<br> Balance. To be <em class="PTAG"></em> truly grey. </p>
			<p class="mt text-center text-medium"> Do you wish to walk in the shade? </p>
