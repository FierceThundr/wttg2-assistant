					<p class="text-justify">
					But he was also an alien and his home planet was called ookpop. He has a <a class="CFTAG">rocket</a> ship and it can go 9,000,000 miles a

					<p class="text-justify"> He saw a <a class="CPTAG">man</a> named the president! The president fainted. He was under a spell! </p>

					<p class="text-justify"> But it wasn't a <a class="CPTAG">wizard</a> it was just that he was scared of <a class="CFTAG">purple</a> cave man
						monster's ship crashing in front of him. So then the president got angry and for that <em class="PTAG"></em>
						he shot a laser at him but the president dodged it. </p>
