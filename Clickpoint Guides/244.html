		<h1 class="strong"> BORROW <em class="PTAG"></em> MY DAUGHTER </h1>
		<p> My daughter has decided she's a grown up and wont be with me. Which means she's <a class="CPTAG">finally</a> ready to start earning some money
			around here. I'm sick and tired of providing for her with no return. I give her a place to live and food to eat and she
			is off with some other <a class="CFTAG">guy</a>. No more. She treats me horribly and wont love me. So I will treat her like the trash she is.
			I'm offering up my daughter for sexual favors to the highest bidder. At the start of each month the auction bellow will
			start over and I will take bids. If you are the highest <a class="CPTAG">bidder</a>, you get my daughter for a week to do whatever you please.
			It's that simple. You will return her in one week and you will pay for all travel expenses. So you know your money is
			safe, you need an escrow account, please provide an <a class="CFTAG">escrow</a> ID with your bid amount. Your money is not taken until I choose
			a high bidder and we both agree. </p>

		<h1 class="strong"> MY DAUGHTER </h1>
		<p> Call her whatever you like. I don't care. She had a name but she gave it up when she started acting the way she has. I
			keep her fed and sheltered so she will be healthy on arrival. </p>
		<p><a class="CPTAG"><img src="images/daughter.jpg" width="720"></a></p>
		<h1 class="strong"> TRAVEL </h1>
		<p> I will ship her anywhere in the world provided that you pay for all travel arrangements. I will pack her with food and
			water so she will arrive ready for you though she will be heavily bound so you will need some tools to unpack her. She
			may try to run so be prepared to restrain her instantly. </p>
		<h1 class="strong"> DEPOSIT </h1>
		<p> I also require a deposit of 1000 <em class="PTAG"></em> DOScoin in escrow that will expire and be returned to you once she has arrived back to
			me safely. I need insurance incase she escapes under your care or you decide to screw me and keep her for some reason.
			</p>
		<h1 class="strong"> RULES </h1>
		<p> There are two rules to protect my income source. Everything is fair game with the exception of <a class="CFTAG">extremes</a>: </p>
		<ul class="mb">
			<li> No Murder - if she is killed, you lose the deposit. </li>
			<li> No permanent damage - She needs <em class="PTAG"></em> to remain whole for her next buyer so no amputation or lasting mutilation </li>
		</ul>
		<p class="text-large text-grey"> HAPPY BIDDING </p>
