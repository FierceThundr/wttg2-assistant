		<p> You have been blinded by the love of the flesh and subordinate reason to desire. </p>
		<p> Women are fraught with sin. From the damning <em class="PTAG"></em> missteps of Eve to the shameful sluts sharing images of their flesh for the
			world to feel validated in their meaningless efforts to seduce for money. They seek nothing but lustful desire and to
			be seen as whores. </p>
		<p> I see you. I have followed you from within your house. I <a class="CFTAG">smell</a> you. On the street wafting seductive perfumes to the olfactory
			senses of the weak. I feel you. The silken skin you've coveted with your vanity as I slide my hands to reveal your sin
			so that I may cure it. </p>
		<p class="text-quote strong"> "They are the ones who caused the <a class="CPTAG">plague</a> to strike the LORD's people. Now kill all the boys and all the women who have
			slept with a man. Only the young girls who are virgins may live; you may keep them for yourselves." Numbers 31:7-18 </p>
		<p> Death is what is deserved for your perversions to <a class="CPTAG">humanity</a>. </p>
		<p> However, I pity your souls. You are weak and unable to fight the temptations of Lucifer. You are not without faults. Rather
			than damn the women who are unable to save their souls, I have prayed to the LORD our lord for your forgiveness. I weep
			for your destiny in hell. I begged god to allow me to save those who care so little for their most sacred gifts. The LORD
			has answered. </p>
		<p> I am here to deliver the word of our <em class="PTAG"></em> LORD god that no woman may need be killed for laying with another man when I force
			myself upon them. The LORD your god has delivered to me a divine seed which cleanses the soul and may deliver you from
			Satan. You may be re-born through the light of my loins. Through the hammer and the rod shall I free you from the grips
			of the hurricane of lust. </p>
		<p> When I give myself into you, you will be <a class="CFTAG">unwilling</a>. Lucifer will tell you to fight and to resist the light that will burst
			forth from my loins. God's own hand reaching through to your soul to set it free. You will not see it. Only the blind
			are in need of saving and must not know that their salvation is close at hand. You will not hear it. The devil is cunning
			and will make you run if you hear my <a class="CPTAG">advances</a>. There will be pain. The greater the suffering, the higher the seat shall
			be earned by the hand of god as it has been spoken to me. </p>
		<p> All women who have laid with a man outside of holy vows have been damaged and their souls lost. The men corrupted by your
			sinful lust. The <a class="CFTAG">damage</a> done to the flock of the earth is immense. I am your only redemption. Take my gift to you in holey
			light born from the fluids of our creation or burn forever in hell for if you fail to give in to the love of our lord,
			I will be forced to carry out the original <em class="PTAG"></em> wishes of our LORD, forcing you through the gates of hell and bring you to
			Lucifer. I take no pleasure in your desecration. This is our burden and our pain to share. </p>
		<p> The god light of my loins will cleans the sinful. These are the wishes of our all mighty god. </p>
