		</div>

			<p> The walls at your sides. The way you deal with the world around you. It can be difficult to ignore the influences of the
				outside world. Many will try to stop you from being neutral. People wish to have others enter their lives either through
				inviting behavior or forceful actions. These <em class="PTAG"></em> are often over miniscule things like being cut off in traffic. They are
				angry about their day but it has no influence on you. Or trying to share every last detail of some grand vacation they
				just had which you may never take. It's <a class="CPTAG">wonderful</a> for them but has no impact on you. </p>
			<p> This may seem uncaring at first but when you look honestly at your own emotions. How often are you truly happy for another
				person when they have <a class="CFTAG">something</a> good that happened to them? It happens yes, with the ones you love mostly, but more often
				than not, you simply are playing a part. You are feeding them the positive emotions they seek. You are exhausting yourself
				through a kind lie. </p>
			<p> One in grey would simply enjoy their <a class="CPTAG">experiences</a> and understand that it is theirs to enjoy we do not seek and we do not
				boast. Not because we are uncaring, simply because it is better to understand that life is about enjoying your own path.
				This is our way. You to yours and I to mine. </p>
			<p> Our angry encounter also has no influence on you if you choose it so. They may have had a hard day or maybe are late to
				something so they drive <a class="CFTAG">carelessly</a> but ask yourself this: does their reason really matter? Does it affect your day? Their
				anger can be frustrating if you let it but if you follow the shade, it has no baring on your life. The <a class="CPTAG CFTAG">moment</a> has come
				and gone so continue in your world. Forget about theirs. </p>
			<p> Follow this simple thinking in all aspects of life. How important is someone else's life to you and the way you live yours?
				Who they sleep with. What they put <em class="PTAG"></em> in their body. What they believe. This in no way changes who you are. You will still
				live the way you choose <a class="CFTAG">regardless</a> of the path your neighbor walks. If it does not infringe upon your way of life. It
				holds no influence on you and may be thrown away. </p>
			<p> Care not for the choices of others. If it leaves your life in peace. Let them live in peace. This is the latus. If you
				can understand and live by this concept, you have built your first wall. You to yours and I to mine. </p>
