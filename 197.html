        <h1>THE ARCH</h1>
        <p>The arch reaches deep into the earth's core where it can pull from the
             earth's <a class="CPTAG">magnetic</a> energies. This is used to transmit a <a class="CFTAG">beam</a> powerful enough to re-charge our sun!
             The Anunnaki understood that coronal mass <em class="PTAG"></em> ejections are a sign of a dying star so one of their
             last gifts to us was the ability to re-charge our <a class="CPTAG">dying</a> sun allowing us to continue life in our solar system.

        <p>The arch was transported here (not built) in 1963. The construction was a top <a class="CFTAG">secret</a> project
             to cover the <a class="CPTAG">drilling</a> to the center of the earth's core which started in 1948 when the descendants of the
             Anunnaki met with Truman who <em class="PTAG"></em> convinced them that America was the only safe place to <a class="CFTAG">keep</a> the arch after World War 2.
